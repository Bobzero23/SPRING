/*Sometimes we want to create bean according to a condition and by that register bean method will be helpful
* This method accepts three parameters ("nameOfTheBean",TypeOfTheBean,ObjectOfTheSupplierInterface)
* As you can see we use interface and that is a functional interface tho we gonna use lambda expression
*
* Note: This time we don't use the component annotation in the field classes */
