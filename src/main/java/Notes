BEANS WITH XML
1. I had to create xml file manually myself while learning how to create beans using xml file
2. In this section we created the connection with the bean using xml so better check the xml file in resources
3. Here the xml file acts as the Pojo class
3. In the main method we have to use another way of creating object of IoC Container go check it
and there you pass the name of the xml file folder you created
